# NYC_Collisions
Digitaley drive capstone project

# Objectives
To present data on traffic collisions in New York City, primarily using Power BI visuals.

1. Identify High-Risk Areas
 * Pinpoint streets, highways, or intersections with the highest number of traffic collisions.
2. Understand Temporal Patterns
 * Analyze how collision rates vary by month, day of the week, and time of day to uncover peak periods of road risk.
3. Determine Leading Causes of Accidents
 * Examine contributing factors such as driver distraction, speeding, or failure to yield to identify the root causes.
4. Evaluate Crash Frequency by Road Type and Location
 * Compare accident rates on expressways vs. local roads, and across boroughs or neighborhoods (if available).
5. Assess Yearly Collision Trends (2021 Focus)
 * Track the frequency of accidents over the course of 2021 to detect increases, decreases, or recurring patterns.
6. Support Policy and Safety Recommendations
 * Use insights to propose data-driven strategies for improving traffic safety and reducing crash rates.
7. Improve Public Awareness and Enforcement
 * Provide actionable information that could be used for awareness campaigns and resource allocation by law enforcement.
 8. Highlight Data Gaps and Reporting Issues
 * Address limitations such as a high percentage of “unspecified” contributing factors in collision reports.

# Data Overview 
The NYC Collisions was sourced from 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1huf7nbHNZdzr4N6QUvURxeWU-G27KSYU3Kl3v_heXgw/edit#gid=1166525029

# Skills Demonstrated 
- Data gathering 
- Dataset cleaning and transformation 
- Data Visualisation
- Quick Measures
- Dashboard Automation

# Key Findings and Analysis
1. Top High-Risk Streets  
These roads are major traffic corridors, many being expressways.
Likely causes: congestion, speeding, interchanges, and limited enforcement zones.
Streets like Broadway may also suffer from pedestrian and cyclist conflict zones.

2. **Monthly Trends in Collisions**
 Peak accident season: May–October, aligning with increased travel, vacations, and construction season.
Lowest months are in winter, possibly due to less travel or higher caution. 

3. **Accidents by Day of Week**
Monday has the highest collision rate, potentially due to post-weekend fatigue and peak rush hour.
Weekends, especially Sunday, are lower but may see different accident types. 

4. **Leading Causes of Accidents**
 Unspecified and Driver Inattention/Distraction are the two highest leading causes of accidents.

5. **Total Accident Volume** (Year 2021–2023)
Total record of 111,000 accidents
Fairly consistent across the years, implying:
No substantial year-over-year improvement and A need for new safety strategies

# Insights 
Despite growing awareness, accident rates have not declined significantly.
Over 40% of accidents are caused by driver behavior: distraction, inattention, tailgating.
The high number of "Unspecified" cases highlights a gap in police reports or data collection quality. 
Accidents peaked in late spring and summer.
February and January were safest — likely due to reduced travel or weather-induced caution.
Monday had the highest collisions, likely due to weekday rush hour stress and fatigue. Weekends, especially Sunday, saw fewer accidents.

# Recommendations
*Improve Data Collection: The high "Unspecified" rate suggests a need for better accident report training for officers.
*Target High-Risk Corridors: Focus safety resources on Belt Parkway, Broadway and major expressways.
*Behavior-Focused Campaigns: Specifically address driver inattention and tailgating.
*Seasonal Resource Allocation: More patrols and awareness in high-accident months.
*Tech Integration: Use AI-powered surveillance or sensors on high-risk roads for early detection and prevention.
